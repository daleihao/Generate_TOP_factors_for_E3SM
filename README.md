# Matlab codes to generate TOP factors for E3SM
## 1. The 1km TOP data was generated based on MERIT DEM, which is stored in ```/global/cfs/cdirs/e3sm/daleihao/TOP_data``` in ```perlmutter```.
## 2. The matlab code can be used to upscale from 1km to 0.5/1.0 degree.
## 3. The matlab code can be used to add the TOP factors into the existing surface data.
